                        How else could I keep up with my schedule during senior year? Each week I create and complete more than 50 tasks. As soon as I remeber something I need to do, I have to create a task or it will leave my mind. I'm constantly checking this guy!

                        Google Calendar isn't the only Google App I use, the whole system keeps me together. From sheets to slides, I like having everything in one place. I usually have at least two of these windows on my laptop in class.

                        Working as an RA, this is the best way for me to keep in contact with my residents. There are  lots of great groups to join for clubs and orgs on campus like BSU. It's how I stay up to date, but it's also part of the reason I'm constantly on my phone!

                        Half checking my own feed, half checking the analytics for the Cultural Centers. Part of interning for them is making sure I'm actually getting people to come to events! Sometimes it feels silly checking instagram for my job, but it's more fun than other things I've done.

                        Notablity is the main way that I take notes in class! Using my Ipad, I can record and import photos of the lecture which makes it much easier for me to study and do assignments. I often miss things in class becasue I'm trying to get my thoughts down on the 'page,' but this way I can just listen later. I've caught many tidbits that make or break my understanding of a concept using this method.

                        I have to find inspiration somewhere! I have a widget on my phone and Ipad to keep my mind focused on what I want to do. Pins inspire my style, interior design, and serve as general affirmations. Investing in your furtue is a kind of self care.

                        Spotify is the literal soundtrack to my life. Every day you see me, these headphone are on my head. Music helps me stay calm and escape for the small moments I get alone between classes. I constantly ensure that my headphones (and back up earphones) are chaged and in my bag before I go anywhere. Music sets the tone for my day.

                        In a transit first city, you must have the best apps to track your times. Over the years, I've learned that the Transit app is far superior to Apple maps for seasoned riders, and now I use it everyday. Transit has the most accurate times and is easiest to use for a quick refrence of the bus times around you. They also provide multiple very well timed audio announcments about your trip so you can get directions without having to use your phone on a crowded bus!

                        My apple watch is the most vital part of my every day tech use, mostly because it is literally attached to me! I use my watch to do most things I deem to be fast tasks; liking a message or checking the wether are quick and easy from my watch. I also find it a vital compnent of my health managment. By tracking my workouts and sets on my watch, I can avoid getting stuck on my phone in the gym and stay focused on myworkout!
